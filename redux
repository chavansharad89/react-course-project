-Component State and Redux is aim to solve you application state.
-So both solves the same problem tracking , chnaging data.

-Component state vs Redux 
1. simple application and complex application
-State can be managed in simple pplication with component state.
-When there is only one component tree then application state cn be managed by component state.
-When we have multiple component tree , sharing data between those component is not easy.
So it is not a good way to go with component state. it cn be solved with Redux.

2. Components Really aren't reusable.
- Component tree is communicating a lot due to the component state and props. And it makes difficult to use component again. 
-Because child compnent is expecting so many things from parent.


-What is Redux:
-Redux is state container.
-Redux is used to mange state.
-It is like object like we store state.
-Redux defines what data component needs and what data needs to be changed.
